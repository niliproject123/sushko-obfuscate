you need to fix a bug
in a folder provided you'll find description of bug in attached file
you may find attached data of input and output

go over initial logic, then design a a test that checks the bug
the test should be short, concise, and well explaind
after designing the test, describe it to the user

after writing the test, agree with the developer/user about its content before continuing
run the test,correct code and continue until the bug is fixed
DONT CHANGE THE TEST FILE W/O NOTIFYING THE USER!!!

at end of work, describe exacly what was done, and what was the bug
put all files (descriptions, covalent diagrams, test files) produced  in the folder provided, unless instructed differently
